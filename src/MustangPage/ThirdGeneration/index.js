            The 1979 Mustang was based on the larger Fox platform (initially
            developed for the 1978 Ford Fairmont and Mercury Zephyr). The larger
            body with an increased wheelbase yielded more interior space for
            four passengers, especially in the back seat, as well as a larger
            capacity trunk and a bigger engine bay.
          </p>
          <p>
            Body styles included a coupe (or notchback), hatchback, and
            convertible which was added for the 1983 model year. Available trim
            levels included an unnamed base model (1979–1981), Ghia (1979–1981),
            Cobra (1979–1981, 1993), L (1982–1984), GL (1982–1983), GLX
            (1982–1983), GT (1982–1993), Turbo GT (1983–1984), LX (1984–1993),
            GT-350 20th anniversary edition (1984), SVO (1984–1986) and Cobra R
            (1993).

            Engines and drivetrains carried over from the Mustang II including
            the 2.3 L I4, 2.8 L V6, and 4.9 L V8 engines. A troublesome 2.3 L
            turbocharged I4 was available during initial production startup and
            then reappeared after undergoing improvements for the mid-year
            introduction of the 1983 turbo GT. The 2.8 L V6, in short supply,
            was replaced with a 3.3 L I6 engine during the 1979 model year. That
            engine was ultimately replaced with a new 3.8 L V6 for 1983. The 302
            cu in (4.9 L) V8 was suspended after 1979 and replaced with a
            smaller, 4.2 L V8 which was dropped in favor of the high output 302
            cu in (4.9 L) V8 for 1982.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 1979 to 1986, the Capri was domestically produced as a
            Mercury-badged version of the Mustang, using a few of its own
            styling cues.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third-generation Mustang had two different front-end styles.
            From 1979 to 1986, the front end was angled back using four
            rectangular headlights, known by enthusiasts as "four eyes". The
            front end was restyled for 1987 to 1993 model years to reflect the
            contemporary, rounded-off "aero" style of the Ford Taurus using
            flush-composite headlamps and a smooth grille-less nose.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Mustang was selected as the 1979 Official Indianapolis 500 Pace
            Car with replicas sold to the public. Its special body-appearance
            parts were adapted by the Cobra package for 1980–81.
          </p>
          <p>
            1982 marked the return of the Mustang GT (replacing the Cobra) which
            used a specially-modified high-output 302 cu in (4.9 L) engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            1983 saw the return of the Mustang convertible after a nine-year
            absence. The front fascias of all Mustangs were restyled, featuring
            new grilles, sporting "blue oval" Ford emblems for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            1984 introduced the high-performance Mustang SVO, which featured a
            2.3 L turbocharged and intercooled four-cylinder engine and unique
            bodywork.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Mustang celebrated its 20th anniversary with a special GT350
            model in white with red interior and red lower-bodyside rocker
            stripes. 1985 Mustangs received another front-fascia restyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to poor sales and escalating fuel prices during the
            early 1980s, a new Mustang was in development. It was to be a
            variant of the Mazda MX-6 assembled at AutoAlliance International in
            Flat Rock, Michigan. Enthusiasts wrote to Ford objecting to the
            proposed change to a front-wheel drive, Japanese-designed Mustang
            without a V8 option. The result was the continuation of the existing
            Mustang while the Mazda MX-6 variant had a last-minute name change
            from Mustang to Probe and was released as a 1989 model.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Mustang received a major restyling for 1987, including the
            interior, which carried it through the end of the 1993 model year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the newly established Ford SVT division, the 1993 Ford Mustang
            SVT Cobra and Cobra R were added as special, high-performance
            models.
