            Lee Iacocca's assistant general manager and chief engineer, Donald
            N. Frey was the head engineer for the T-5 project—supervising the
            overall development of the car in a record 18 months—while Iacocca
            himself championed the project as Ford Division general manager. The
            T-5 prototype was a two-seat, mid-mounted engine roadster. This
            vehicle employed the German Ford Taunus V4 engine.

            The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved
            into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which Ford used to
            pretest how the public would take interest in the first production
            Mustang. The 1963 Mustang II concept car was designed with a
            variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof
            that was 2.7 in (69 mm) lower. It was originally based on the
            platform of the second-generation North American Ford Falcon, a
            compact car. Gale Halderman's side view design is the basis for the
            first clay model.

            Non-traditional (1964½) introduction
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Ford Mustang began production five months before the normal
            start of the 1965 production year. The early production versions are
            often referred to as "1964½ models", but all Mustangs were
            advertised, VIN coded and titled by Ford as 1965 models, though
            minor design updates in August 1964 at the formal start of the 1965
            production year contribute to tracking 19641⁄2 production data
            separately from 1965 data (see data below). With production
            beginning in Dearborn, Michigan, on March 9, 1964; the new car was,
            on 14 April 1964, first sold to the public, at a Ford dealership in
            St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada before it was even introduced on
            April 17, 1964, at the New York World's Fair. Body styles available
            included a two-door hardtop and convertible, with a "2+2" fastback
            added to the line in September 1964. A Wimbledon White (paint code
            P) convertible with red interior was used as product placement when
            the James Bond movie Goldfinger was released September 17, 1964, at
            its London premiere, where Bond girl Tilly Masterson was in a
            spirited chase with James driving an Aston Martin DB5 in the Swiss
            Alps. A Tropical Turquoise (paint code O) coupe was again used in
            the next film Thunderball at its Tokyo premiere 9 December 1965 with
            Bond girl Fiona Volpe as she drives James to meet the villain Emilio
            Largo at his compound at a very high speed across The Bahamas.

          <p>
            Favorable publicity articles appeared in 2,600 newspapers the next
            morning, the day the car was "officially" revealed. A four-seat car
            with full space for the front bucket seats and a rear bench seat was
            standard. A "fastback 2+2", first manufactured on August 17, 1964,
            enclosed the trunk space under a sweeping exterior line similar to
            the second series Corvette Sting Ray and European sports cars such
            as the Jaguar E-Type coupe.

          <h3 className="section__heading">Price and record-breaking sales</h3>
          <p>
            To achieve an advertised list price of US$2,368 (equivalent to
            $22,895 in 2023), the Mustang was based heavily on familiar yet
            simple components, many of which were already in production for
            other Ford models. Many (if not most) of the interior, chassis,
            suspension, and drivetrain components were derived from those used
            on Ford's Falcon and Fairlane. This use of common components also
            shortened the learning curve for assembly and repair workers, while
            at the same time allowing dealers to pick up the Mustang without
            also having to invest in additional spare parts inventory to support
            the new car line. Original sales forecasts projected less than
            100,000 units for the first year. This mark was surpassed in three
            months from rollout. Another 318,000 would be sold during the model
            year (a record), and in its first eighteen months, more than one
            million Mustangs were built.
          </p>
          <h3 className="section__heading">Upgrades</h3>
          <p>
            Several changes were made at the traditional opening of the new
            model year (beginning August 1964), including the addition of
            back-up lights on some models, the introduction of alternators to
            replace generators, an upgrade of the six-cylinder engine from 170
            to 200 cu in (2.8 to 3.3 L) with an increase from 101 to 120 hp (75
            to 89 kW), and an upgrade of the V8 engine from 260 to 289 cu in
            (4.3 to 4.7 L) with an increase from 164 to 210 hp (122 to 157 kW).
            The rush into production included some unusual quirks, such as the
            horn ring bearing the 'Ford Falcon' logo covered by a trim ring with
            a 'Ford Mustang' logo. These characteristics made enough difference
            to warrant designation of the 121,538 early versions as "1964½"
            Mustangs, a distinction that has endured with purists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ford's designers began drawing up larger versions even as the
            original was achieving sales success, and while "Iacocca later
            complained about the Mustang's growth, he did oversee the 1967
            redesign." From 1967 until 1973, the Mustang got bigger but not
            necessarily more powerful. The Mustang was facelifted, giving the
            Mustang a more massive look overall and allowing a big block engine
            to be offered for the first time. Front and rear end styling was
            more pronounced, and the "twin cove" instrument panel offered a
            thicker crash pad and larger gauges. Hardtop, fastback, and
            convertible body styles continued as before. Around this time, the
            Mustang was paired with a Mercury variant, called the Cougar, which
            used its own styling cues, such as a "prowling cat" logo and hidden
            quad headlamps. New safety regulations by the U.S. National Highway
            Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for 1967 included an
            energy-absorbing steering column and wheel, 4-way emergency
            flashers, and a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system, and softer
            interior knobs. The 1968 models received revised side scoops,
            steering wheel, and gasoline caps. Side marker lights were also
            added that year, and cars built after January 1, 1968, included
            shoulder belts for both front seats on coupes. The 1968 models also
            introduced a new 302 cu in (4.9 L) V8 engine, designed with Federal
            emissions regulations in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 1969 restyle "added more heft to the body as width and length
            again increased. Weight went up markedly too." Due to the larger
            body and revised front end styling, the 1969 models (but less so in
            1970) had a notable aggressive stance. The 1969 models featured
            "quad headlamps" which disappeared to make way for a wider grille
            and a return to standard headlamps in the 1970 models. This switch
            back to standard headlamps was an attempt to tame the aggressive
            styling of the 1969 model, which some felt was too extreme and hurt
            sales, but 1969 production exceeded the 1970 total.
          </p>
          <h3 className="section__heading">Models</h3>
          <p>
            Starting in 1969, to aid sales and continue the winning formula of
            the Mustang, a variety of new performance and decorative options
            became available, including functional (and non-functional) air
            scoops, cable and pin hood tie-downs, and both wing and chin
            spoilers. Additionally, a variety of performance packages were
            introduced that included the Mach 1, the Boss 302, and Boss 429. The
            two Boss models were to homologate the engines for racing. The 1969
            Mustang was the last year for the GT option (although it did return
            on the third-generation Mustang for the 1982 model year). A fourth
            model available only as a hardtop, the Grandé, saw success starting
            in 1969 with its soft ride, "luxurious" trim, 55 pounds of extra
            sound deadening, and simulated wood trim.
          </p>
          <h3 className="section__heading">Sales fluctuation</h3>
          <p>
            Developed under the watch of S. "Bunkie" Knudsen, Mustang evolved
            "from speed and power" to the growing consumer demand for bigger and
            heavier "luxury" type designs. "The result was the styling
            misadventures of 1971–73 ...the Mustang grew fat and lazy," "Ford
            was out of the go-fast business almost entirely by 1971." "This was
            the last major restyling of the first-generation Mustang." "The cars
            grew in every dimension except height, and they gained about 800
            pounds (360 kg)." "The restyling also sought to create the illusion
            that the cars were even larger." The 1971 Mustang was nearly 3
            inches (75 mm) wider than the 1970, its front and rear track was
            also widened by 3 inches (75 mm), and its size was most evident in
            the SportsRoof models with its nearly flat rear roofline and cramped
            interior with poor visibility for the driver. Performance decreased
            with sales continuing to decrease as consumers switched to the
            smaller Pintos and Mavericks. A displeased Iacocca summed up later:
            "The Mustang market never left us, we left it."
