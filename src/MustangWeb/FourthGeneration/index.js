            In November 1993, the Mustang debuted its first major redesign in
            fifteen years. Code-named "SN95" by the automaker, it was based on
            an updated version of the rear-wheel drive Fox platform called
            "Fox-4." The new styling by Patrick Schiavone incorporated several
            styling cues from earlier Mustangs. For the first time since its
            introduction 1964, a notchback coupe model was not available. The
            door windows on the coupe were once again frameless; however, the
            car had a fixed "B" pillar and rear windows.
          </p>
          <p>
            The base model came with a 3.8 OHV V6 3.8 L (232 cu in) engine rated
            at 145 bhp (108 kW) in 1994 and 1995, or 150 bhp (110 kW)
            (1996–1998), and was mated to a standard 5-speed manual transmission
            or optional 4-speed automatic. Though initially used in the 1994 and
            1995 Mustang GTS, GT and Cobra, Ford retired the 302 cid pushrod
            small-block V8 after nearly 30 years of use, replacing it with the
            newer Modular 4.6 L (281 cu in) SOHC V8 in the 1996 Mustang GT. The
            4.6 L V8 was initially rated at 215 bhp (160 kW), 1996–1997, but was
            later increased to 225 bhp (168 kW) in 1998.
          </p>
          <p>
            For 1999, the Mustang was reskinned with Ford's New Edge styling
            theme with sharper contours, larger wheel arches, and creases in its
            bodywork, but its basic proportions, interior design, and chassis
            remained the same as the previous model. The Mustang's powertrains
            were carried over for 1999, but benefited from new improvements. The
            standard 3.8 L V6 had a new split-port induction system, and was
            rated at 190 bhp (140 kW) 1999–2000, while the Mustang GT's 4.6 L V8
            saw an increase in output to 260 bhp (190 kW) (1999–2004), due to a
            new head design and other enhancements. In 2001, the 3.8 L was
            increased to 193 bhp.[55] In 2004, a 3.9 L variant of the Essex
            engine replaced the standard 3.8 L mid year with an increase of 3
            ft⋅lb (4 N⋅m) of torque as well as NVH improvements. There were also
            three alternate models offered in this generation: the 2001 Bullitt,
            the 2003 and 2004 Mach 1, as well as the 320 bhp (240 kW) 1999 and
            2001, and 390 bhp (290 kW) 2003 and 2004 Cobra.

          <p>
            This generation was sold in Australia between 2001 and 2002, to
            compete against the Holden Monaro (which eventually became the basis
            for the reborn Pontiac GTO). Due to the fact that the Mustang was
            never designed for right-hand-drive, Ford Australia contracted
            Tickford Vehicle Engineering to convert 250 Mustangs and modify them
            to meet Australian Design Rules per year. The development cost for
            redesigning the components and setting up the production process was
            A$4,000,000. Sales did not meet expectations, due in part to a high
            selling price. In total, just 377 Mustangs were sold in Australia
            between 2001 and 2003. For promotional purposes, Ford Racing
            Australia also built a Mustang V10 convertible, which was powered by
            a Ford Modular 6.8 L V10 engine from the American F truck series but
            fitted with an Australian-made Sprintex supercharger.
