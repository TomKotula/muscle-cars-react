            Iacocca, who had been one of the forces behind the original Mustang,
            became president of Ford Motor Company in 1970, and ordered a
            smaller, more fuel-efficient Mustang for 1974. Initially, it was to
            be based on the Ford Maverick, but ultimately was based on the Ford
            Pinto subcompact.

            The new model, called the "Mustang II", was introduced on September
            21, 1973, two months before the first 1973 oil crisis, and its
            reduced size allowed it to compete against successful imported
            sports coupes such as the Japanese Datsun 240Z, Toyota Celica and
            the European Ford Capri (then Ford-built in Germany and Britain,
            sold in U.S. by Mercury as a captive import car). The Mustang II
            also later competed against the Chevrolet Monza, Pontiac Sunbird,
            Oldsmobile Starfire and Buick Skyhawk. First-year sales were 385,993
            cars, compared with the original Mustang's twelve-month sales record
            of 418,812. Ultimately, the Mustang II was an early example of
            downsizing that would take place among Detroit's Big Three during
            the "malaise era".

            Iacocca wanted the new car, which returned the Mustang to its 1965
            model year predecessor in size, shape, and overall styling, to be
            finished to a high standard, saying it should be "a little jewel".
            Not only was it smaller than the original car, but it was also
            heavier, owing to the addition of equipment needed to meet new U.S.
            emission and safety regulations. Performance was reduced, and
            despite the car's new handling and engineering features the
            galloping mustang emblem "became a less muscular steed that seemed
            to be cantering".

            Engines for the 1974 models included the venerable 2.3 L I4 from the
            Pinto and the 2.8 L Cologne V6 from the Mercury Capri. The 1975
            model year reintroduced the 302 cu in (4.9 L) Windsor V8 that was
            only available with the C-4 automatic transmission, power brakes,
            and power steering. This continued through production's end in 1978.
            Other transmissions were the RAD four-speed with unique gearing for
            all three engines, and the C-3 automatic behind the 2.3 L and 2.8 L.
            The "5.0 L" marketing designation was not applied until the 1978
            King Cobra model. All 302 cu in (4.9 L)-equipped Mustang IIs, except
            the King Cobras, received updated versions of the classic Ford "V8"
            emblem on each front fender.

            The car was available in coupe and hatchback versions, including a
            "luxury" Ghia model designed by Ford's recently acquired Ghia of
            Italy. The coupe was marketed as a "hardtop" but actually had a thin
            "B" pillar and rear quarter windows that did not roll down. All
            Mustangs in this generation did feature frameless door glass,
            however. The "Ghia" featured a thickly padded vinyl roof and
            starting with 1975 models smaller rear quarter windows, giving a
            more formal look. 1974 models were: hardtop, hatchback, Mach 1, and
            Ghia. Changes introduced for 1975 included the availability of an
            "MPG" model which had a different rear axle ratio for better fuel
            economy. 1976 added the "Stallion" trim package. The Mach 1 remained
            through the life cycle 1974–1978. Other changes in appearance and
            performance came with a "Cobra II" version in 1976–1978 and a "King
            Cobra" in 1978 of which around 4,972 were built. The 1977–1978
            hatchback models in all trim levels were now available with the
            T-top roof option, which included a leatherette storage bag that
            clipped to the top of the spare tire hump.
